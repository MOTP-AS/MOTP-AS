Version 0.8
  * LDAP support 
	- syncing users/devices from LDAP
	- using LDAP password as temporary password
	- use LDAP values for RADIUS attribute checking/sending/logging
	You can switch LDAP support off by setting USE_LDAP to FALSE.
	See documentation at http://motp-as.network-cube.de/ for how to use
  * Bug fixes
	- ignored configuration settings for RADIUS
	- locked users could login with static passwords
  * Changes and new features
	- splitted configuration settings into preferences, global settings,
	  and LDAP settings
	- new parameter PIN_MIN_LENGTH for minimum length when setting new pins,
	  default is 4, that means all 4 digits must be used.
	- If device was locked because of too many failed login attempts,
	  the try counter will be reset after LOCK_GRACE_MINS minutes.
	  If value is 0 (default), user has to be unlocked manually.
	- Sorting in lists

Version 0.7.2
  * configuration: now via database
	- settings in database are preferred!
	- settings can be changed via web interface
  * IPv6 support
	- RADIUS clients can have IPv6 addresses, but
	- you have to modify Freeradius config (radiusd.conf) to listen to IPv6
	  and replace the file "dynamic-clients" with the new version.
	  Freeradius only listens to either IPv4 or IPv6.
  * logging
	- The server can delete old log entries. Default is not to delete.
	  To purge entries there are three new configuration parameters 
	  LOGS_PURGE_xxx for authentication, accounting and audit log.
        - uniform log entries
  * Web interface
	- simple import/export of database to have a backup.
	- deletion of data now has to be confirmed; you can switch it off.

Version 0.7.1
  * openSUSE image for XEN

Version 0.7
	Please read "warning_0.6-0.7.txt" before updating. This file
	explains the differences to version 0.6 and what you additionally
	have to do beside replacing PHP files and updating database.
  * database
	- You must upgrade database for profiles, see Setup/migrate_0.6-0.7.sql
  * configuration:
	- global configuration in config.php now moved to new database table.
	  Old style configuration in config.php is still valid and preferred
	  as long as there is no web interface for changing config.
  * OTP generation:
	- admins can now generate one time passcodes for testing,
          see flag $GENERATE_PASSCODE in config.php
  	- users can download "HTML client", a very simple motp client.
	  Please be aware, that this client stores secret as cleartext in HTML!
  * Authentication:
	- decreased max allowed drift between device and server to 3 minutes.
	- check username; only alphanumeric and some special characters allowed,
	  all other requests will be rejected! See $VALID_CHARS in config.php
  * RADIUS
	- more checks for input from RADIUS server, see above.
	- RADIUS profiles: You can assign a profile to each user.
	  In the profile you can
		check for RADIUS attributes (reject if wrong or not present)
		assign values to RADIUS attributes (send with Auth Success)
		decide what attributes to log
	  The plan is to make these values variable, when there will be
	  LDAP integration in the far future.
	- new accounting implementation, please adjust "accounting" section
	  like example in Freeradius/accounting (note '%Z' at end of line)
  * Web interface
	- Wizards for
		+ assigning users/devices/accounts in one step
		+ first steps
		+ importing CSV file with users/devices/accounts
	- graphical buttons; 
	  if you don't like it, switch it off with $SHOW_BUTTONS in config.php
	- POST instead of GET for changing settings (add, delete, etc.)
	- about page
  * as always some minor changes ...

Version 0.6
  * Functionality:
	- check of duplicate or empty values for user, RADIUS client, device
	- interactive help for PIN, secret and other form fields
	  If you don't like it, you can disable it in config.php.
	- helpdesk users cannot see secrets in device list 
	- new flag "$SHOW_PIN" in config.php to set, who can see the PIN
	  via Web interface. Of course database contains all PINs and they
	  are not secured crytographically.
  * Database: increased PIN length in database to 8 bytes 
	(because of Android client supports up to 7 digits, standard still 4)
	see Setup/MySQL/migrate_0.5-0.6.sql for automatic conversion of database
	There is no need to change database, if everything is working fine.
  * Update script
	It's the first version, so please backup before running.
	You need the "patch" command, which is not on prior VMware versions
  * openSUSE image
	- Command for sending HUP to Freeradius for reloading, i.e. changes
	  immediatelly take effect

Version 0.5
  * for updating from older versions, please note, that timezone
	settings changed sign (+/-). Please change all timezone settings
	or resync the devices using new function.
  * new features:

  * small changes;
	display/edit of accounts more like users/devices
	better next/prev links for logs

Version 0.4
  * supports secrets with 32 bytes. 
	(for migration from older versions, please convert database using
	command in Setup/migrate_0.3.x-0.4.x.sql)
  * small improvements:
	reports number of locked users/tokens on start page
	shows real time for last device usage
	shows last login of user in list
	filters for user/device status and user role
	logs client (RADIUS, Web)
	indexes for log tables
