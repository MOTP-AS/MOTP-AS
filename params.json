{"name":"MOTP-AS","body":"# Mobile OTP Authentication Server - MOTP-AS\r\n\r\nMOTP-AS is an add-on for the Mobile OTP authentication framework.\r\nFor more details about Mobile OTP see http://motp.sourceforge.net/.\r\n\r\nWith MOTP-AS you can build an authentication server with\r\n\r\n* authenticating users by RADIUS\r\n\r\nRADIUS is a standard protocol used by many routers, firewalls and VPN gateways. It is also possible to use it to authenticate users against Apache, Unix (PAM) and other applications.\r\n\r\n* SQL database for user/device configuration\r\n\r\nAll configuration and administration data is stored into a SQL database. This includes users and devices (secrets)\r\n\r\n* Administration Web Interface\r\n\r\nAdminstration of the SQL database can be performed by an Administration Web Interface which supports different roles for Administrators, Help Desk and Users.\r\n\r\nCompared to other MOTP implementations, MOTP-AS provides the following features:\r\n\r\n* A user can have more then one device or pin, respectively. \r\n* Many users can share the same device (using different pins).\r\n* Users can change their pins by login on the Web Administration Interface\r\n* The server automatically learns device time drifts by storing the time shift\r\n* Users can have temporary static passwords\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please <a href=\"mailto:motp-as@network-cube.de\">send us an email</a>. To report a bug, please use the GitHub bug tracker.","tagline":"An implementation of the M-OTP algorythm, for integration with FreeRadius.
