Please note, that since version 0.7.2 the configuration settings in the database
are preferred. Settings in "config.php" are legacy, only the settings to access
the database are needed.

If you upgrade, the settings in the database will _not_ be set to your values in
"config.php". Please use the Web Interface to change the values in the database!
