Please note following differences in functionality between versions 0.6 and 0.7:

 * Characters of usernames are checked now. If a username contains an invalid
   character, it will be rejected.
   Default valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, '-', '_' and '.'
   You can modify the allowed characters by setting $VALID_CHARS in config.php

 * The script for authentication requests now checks, if it was invoken with
   at least three paramters (Username, Password, Client-Shortname). If not,
   it will deny the requests.
   Please check, that your Freeradius configuration sets these values.
   For an example see file 'Setup/Freeradius/users'.

 * The allowed time difference between device and server is now decreased 
   to +/- 3 minutes by default.
   You may modify this value by changing $MAXDIFF in config.php.

   Please note, that the server remembers the drift, and it can exceed this
   value over time. This setting therefore means the difference to the last
   successful authentication.

 * RADIUS attributes of authentication requests can now be checked:
	a) if a RADIUS attribute is set
	b) if the RADIUS attribute has a defined value
   If this check fails, the authentication fails also without any notice to
   the user (RADIUS client), why the authentication failed.

 * If authentication was sucessful, the server now adds RADIUS attributes
   to the Reply. By default it replies with
	Reply-Message = Hello Friend!
   (This is not true for an update, only for new installations.)

   Please check, that the reply attributes don't confuse your RADIUS client.
   You may delete or change this attribute, as well as add other attributes.

 * The script for accounting was changed, that means you have to change
   your Freeradius configuration, if you use it.
   Please see 'Setup/Freeradius/accouting' as example.
