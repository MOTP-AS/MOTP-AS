Software Packages: For LDAP support, MOTP-AS needs PHP's LDAP module installed. 
On previous pre-build images, this module is not installed, you have to add it 
manually.
If you do not want to use LDAP, you may ignore this. It then makes sense to 
deactivate LDAP support in the general system settings.
