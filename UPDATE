UPDATE
======


PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before updating please read "warning_xx-yy.txt" (xx = your current version)
This file explains the differences to the old version and what you additionally
have to do beside replacing PHP files and updating database.


UPDATING
--------
If you want to update MOTP-AS to the newest version, there are three
possibilites:
   A. Updating using "update.sh" script (see below)
   B. Re-install MOTP-AS (see below)
   C. Updating manually

In all three cases
   1. Backup the current version/server. 
	This can be a snaphsot if MOTP-AS is running as Virtual System, 
	or any other method. 
	Please make sure, that the backup also includes the database.
   2. Update, see below
   3. Test the new version and verify, that everything is still working.
	You should do this immediately after updating, because rolling back
	means, that you also reverts all changes, that have been done since
	update.

A. Updating using "update.sh" script
    a) Download source tgz
    b) extract source and change into directory MOTP-AS_v.../Setup
    c) Execute "./update.sh"
	The script will ask you where your PHP files are installed (html root)
	and how to access database, if there there are changes on database.
    d) Modify additional settings as described in "warning_xx-yy.txt"

B. Re-install MOTP-AS
    a) Backup the data.
	This mainly is the database, but also includes systems modifications,
	which could be amongst others:
		- your settings in config.php
		- changes in Freeradius configuration
		- Apache configuration
		- system accounts (ssh keys, etc.)
		- For database backup you can use phpMyAdmin.
    b) Install new version
    c) Import database backup (using phpMyAdmin for example)
    d) Change system settings in config.php
    e) Restore system modifications, see above
