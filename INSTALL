INSTALLATION of MOTP-AS
=======================


PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need this software installed:
* MySQL
* Apache
* PHP
* FreeRadius 



INSTALLATION
------------

1. Change default username/passwords for database access:
	- Setup/MySQL/motp_schema.sql
	- Setup/config.php

2. Create SQL database
	You can create the database by loading the setup script:
		mysql -u root -p  < Setup/MySQL/motp_schema.sql
	This script will 
		- create a database "motp"
		- create all needed tables in the database "motp"
		- create an db user "motp" with access to db "motp"
		- add user "admin" with static password "motp"
	If you would like to use a different database name, etc.,
	please edit Setup/config.php

3. Install PHP files
	Copy all files in directory HTML (including directories) to 
	your html root.

4. FreeRadius
	Locate your Freeradius config directory (mostly /etc/raddb),
	back up your config files and replace them as described below. 
	After changing, please reload freeradius.

    a) Authentication
	Replace config file "users" by "Setup/Freeradius/users", 
	change paths in "users" to your php binary and html root, respectively. 
	Please verify, that the "exec" module is enabled in "post-auth"
	section, otherwise all requests will be authenticated!

    b) RADIUS clients
	If you do not want to manage your RADIUS clients with MOTP-AS,
	please skip the following steps.
	For managing RADIUS clients, the method depends on your freeradius 
	version: With older versions you have to change "clients.conf", 
	with version 2.1 or newer you can configure freeradius to use 
	dynamic clients.

	For dynamic clients copy "Setup/FreeRadius/dynamic-clients" 
	to "sites-enabled" of your config directory and change paths in 
	"dynamic-clients" (php binary and html root). Freeradius then 
	accepts all clients configured with MOTP-AS.

	For older versions MOTP-AS can generate the file "clients.conf" 
	automatically, if
		- you uncomment and set  RADIUS_CONF_CLIENTS in config.php
		- the apache user (nobody?) has write access to "clients.conf"
	Attention: MOTP-AS will not import existing entries in "clients.conf",
	it will instead override the file.
	After every change of "clients.conf" freeradius must be reoladed.
	MOTP-AS can reload freeradius after writing clients.conf:
		- uncomment and set RADIUS_SERV_RELOAD in config.php
		- the apache user need the rights to execute this command.

    c) Accounting
	replace "accounting" section of "sites-enabled/default" by content
	of file "accounting". Don't forget to change paths.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 - Login to http://your.server/
	Username: admin
	Password: motp

 - Change admin's Password:
	=> ADMINISTRATION
	=> USERS
	=> admin
	=> static password

-------------------------
LDAP
-------------------------

In version 0.8, LDAP functionality was included. It has not been strongly,
and a patch has been submitted to resolve some issues. If you use the new
LDAP functionality with Active Directory users, please add the following
script to your crontab:

/path/to/php -f /path/to/motp-as/ldap.php 1

This functionality will also require additional PHP modules to be installed.
